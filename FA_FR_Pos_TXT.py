Great initial work up of unilateral leg pain. Thought of broad differential and appropriate work up even though final diagnosis is still a conundrum.
Great detail in discharging patients - talked with family, made sure patients had PCP follow up and ability to fill prescriptions - wrote 2 sets of prescription for a pt who wouldn’t be able to get the UNM pharmacy in time to get her first dose after discharge.
Great balance between professional demeanor + conveying caring
Good use of existing UNM clinical notes on patients’ previous visits for improving her understanding of the patients she is evaluating/treating in the ED
Nice bedside U/S of the pt’s heart!
Ashley is a very strong intern. she sees a good number of patients and can develop a good plan of work up and treatment.
Ashley did a great job of evaluating and managing a woman with paranoia. She was able to make a good plan for evaluation of the pt.’s pulmonary nodules, and get her transferred over to MHC for treatment of her psych issue. She maintained good rapport with the pt. throughout the encounter. Great job!!!
Good job managing abdominal pain patients. Looks for causes, good differentials. Keeps me informed
Excellent for level of training
Does VERY well for 1st year. Sees a lot of patients and multitasks
Sees a lot of patients, uses labs well
progressing well. Great fund of knowledge
Handling the pt. flow easily now. Has good plans and workups for each pt that she sees. Ready to start coming back to Resus/Trauma to get accustomed to sicker patients and more acuity. Received a very nice compliment about her care and concern from the family of a pt with a kidney stone!
Is doing a great job of prepping patients for a long ED stay. For example, prior to sign-outs, she is re-evaluating them, re-starting home meds, switching them to a hospital bed, etc.
Ashley managed the floor patients while we were getting pounded in the Trauma/Resus room. She correctly identified the sicker patients and initiated care on them, keeping the pod functional. She did a fantastic job!!! She also dispo’d the signouts after following up on all the test results. A pleasure to work with!
Dr. Crum does a nice job of dissecting the chart for all available information that might help in the care of her patients. Thoughtful approach to the differential diagnosis.
In general, Ashley has excellent PE skills and is very committed to her pediatric patients.
As Ashley’s gotten more comfortable with our system, she has become very effective at managing multiple patients simultaneously and independently manages them.
Excellent evaluations of each patient and good follow-ups with the signouts. Very conscientious and trustworthy.
Ashley is really doing well expanding her comfort level with managing multiple patients and keeping them all on track. She carried the resus pager on shift and did a very good job managing a 48 y/o female with SVT (requiring adenosine to convert to sinus rhythm) and a ~30 y/o male who was very agitated and combative after being assaulted with a baseball bat (+ETOH as well).
Ashley takes an exceptional level of care in discussing important topics in a sensitive way with patient and family, always projecting (and I think genuinely feeling) a compassionate attitude
77 yo h/o dementia, tremor, chronic pain with aggressive behavior, chronic leg pain. Ashley did a particularly good job in talking with patient without talking down, agitating further, addressing his concerns, but also with realistic dispo and common sense approach.
Very good about going back to re-evaluate patients and check up on how they are doing. Enthusiastic about all aspects of her work in the ED. Very positive attitude; exudes confidence.
Not only did Naomi do an exceptionally nice job both teaching a visiting medical student for moderately complex facial lacerations as well as an overall nice job on the repair
Naomi is performing above her level in terms of communicating with all team members and taking on teaching, making it look easy
Naomi does a great job on efficient and thorough charting
Anticipated course, re-evaluated in a timely and appropriate fashion
General comment from shift: Naomi was clearly able to articulate her rationale for ordering/not ordering particular tests during pt workup.
This busy peds ED shift offered lots of opportunity to practice seeing many patients in a short period of time. Naomi handled the volume in a speedy, efficient manner that did not compromise the quality of care that she provided. She seemed comfortable employing time saving strategies to care for patients in a fast but safe manner - prioritizing order entry and discharges, being up to date on lab/imaging results, etc, communicating with nurses re: rate-limiting steps, reevaluating patients in a timely fashion while simultaneously picking up new charts, etc. Notes were completed at the end of the shift rather than during the busy time, and when I checked them in the morning they were complete with an appropriate level of detail. These skills are often not something I see until residents reach their late second or even third year in the ED. Strong work!
Great to work with, complete evals, good differentials
Good job for first day!
Good job for first day
Obviously learning the system - navigating surprisingly well for FIRST ED shift
Discussed difficult patient with chronic pain, IVDU history, and turned out to have significant recent opioid use/abuse - very common sense approach, I expect Greta to rapidly acclimatize to our ED standard approach
Making appropriate dispo plans on own, but checking for appropriateness - perfect
62 yo F h/o DM, acute on chronic AP with several potential for pain but well-appearing. Had a good discussion re: different attending styles, workup of patient’s with DM (diet controlled or no) and older patients with abdominal pain. Greta is navigating the different styles, her own personal approach, and using a very logical set of questions to figure out how she will proceed with patient like this in the future.
Reevaluated pt often with partial sbo vs ileus on ct scan. Appropriate discharge after pt able to tolerate sack lunch and pain improved.
Appropriately ordered a head ct in a syncopal pt who struck his head and had subsequent multiple bouts of emesis.
Very nice job on a lac repair. Outstanding documentation - it is clear, focused, but includes an appropriate amount of medical decision making. Greta’s notes are far more useful than the typical ED notes that I see - keep up the good work! Very diligent, thorough, and careful. Great attitude - a joy to work with on a night shift.
She learned and learned and each time we saw another patient she remembered from the last one and started thinking on her own, what else we could do. What a pleasure to teach her and to work with her.
Greta’s written and documentation skills gave me a lot of satisfaction and joy. She is ways beyond many of her peers and acted like a sponge. The more I could show her, the better it was! I am looking forward to working with her again. Her communication style was clear and direct and non-wavering. She was a true companion to me.
Greta did an outstanding job. Although we were working hard, there was always enough time to joke and discuss patients in detail. Very professional
Great job, sees a lot of patients, keeps me informed
Excellent job. Helps others with their patients as well. Up for a challenge.
Thorough evaluations with good differentials.
Nice job on the cardiac U/S for pt with tachycardia, CP and borderline oxygenation. Able to obtain good images and identify structures.
Very slow night in the ED. Only 7 new patients to see during the shift. Leticia saw 3 of them, and handled the signouts well.

Heather is a true team player in the Peds ED - she is efficient, immediately jumps in to help out any and all team members. Heather is able to communicate effectively and clearly - a pleasure to have in the Ped ED
This is the first time I have worked with Heather, and I was quite impressed. She saw 6 patients on this shift. Her presentations were concise but covered the essential points. She had good plans for each, chose appropriate treatments and medications, etc.
Great patient management and learns VERY quickly
Doing very well. Great patient assessments, evals, re-evals and progress.
Leah is formulating good lists of differential diagnosis without being overly wide
61 yo F h/o bulbar ALS, with urinary symptoms, but also significant tachycardia. Good job in overall workup, approach, we discussed thinking ahead to dispo.
Follows up on patients from prior shifts. Asked for feedback and is very receptive.
Dispo’d all of her patients from the shift. Appropriate level of care.
Appropriately treated chronic abd pain with dilaudid at right dose
Good job of evaluating the pt with achalasia, getting CT, involving EGS. Very interesting pt. Also did a nice job of giving discharge advice to pt with non-cardiac CP, and treating GERD.
Very caring attitude toward patients and families while maintaining objective view of the situation. Involves family in hx of problem.
Handles the flow in the ED, new and old patients, easily.
carefully assessed an elderly male with a hip fracture and low BP, eliminating several causes for the hypotension. Continued to assess the pt throughout the shift.
Beginning to formulate appropriate differentials in the pediatric population. Anticipate Dr. Sycamore broadening her differential as the year progresses.
Digital block on a 1 1/2 year old patient was excellent. Identified landmarks, discussed different approaches - in the end - excellent block with subsequent patient comfort for crush injury repair.
Slow shift with no real opportunity to pick up many patients. Kristina was careful and thorough and provided good attention to the patients that she was able to pick up. Patient presentations were organized.
Great job placing your first central line!
Did a nice job on a paracentesis - her first. Reviewed the procedure, prepared the site and the patient, dealt with the issue of poor flow. also kept track of patients signed out to her, ensuring that workups were completed and dispositions done. Very good job overall!
Very rational, thoughtful approach to work ups of your patients.
Kristina saw 8 patients on a fairly busy shift. Very thorough evaluation of each patient with a good plan for each. Used U/S to help her evaluate appropriate patient complaints without being prompted. Great job overall!
Very slow night - 7 patients total. Kristina did a nice job. No issues. We did some U/S looking for peripheral nerves in the forearm.
Kristina has adapted to the Ed very well. She is comfortable in evaluating a wide variety of patients, asks questions when she is unsure, closely follows her own and signed out patients. Great to work with!
excellent work on a VERY difficult patient, calmly and persistently got patient dispo’d
Good use of ultrasound in patient with flank pain.
Excellent job obtaining accurate histories and physical exams. Good differential diagnoses, appropriately prioritized. Good judgement for an intern at this stage of training. Hardworking, a joy to work with!

Very comfortable with consulting services to help with the management of her patients. Rachel had several ESRD patients with complex complaints. Skillfully coordinated care of these patients with nephrology, internal medicine and surgery.
Outstanding diagnostician well above expectations for an intern - picks up subtle hx and physical findings for clinical decision making.
Always proactive about asking for feedback. Outstanding for asking for help when she is uncomfortable with next step/management.
Emailed neurosurgery (in addition to discussion with them in the ED) without prompting to ensure followup plan for pt who needed close follow up. Goes extra mile to make sure patients get the right follow up.
Demonstrated compassion for a difficult patient and effectively was able to get a disposition plan.

Dr. Horner routinely seeks patient feedback to help optimize satisfaction, aware of patient flow through the ED and communicates effectively w/nursing staff to help optimize flow through the ED.
Dr. Horner will continue to improve in this area. She is at or above where she should be at this point in her training.
Dr. Horner is always a pleasure to work with. I feel she shows exemplary skills for her level of training, particularly with her differential diagnosis, her documentation, her interaction with patients and with the clinical staff. She was very proactive in attempting her first hematoma block and did a great job, saving a patient from needing procedural sedation for his wrist fracture and assisted Ortho in the splinting procedure. Dr. Horner always re-assess her patients in a timely manner and updates her notes accordingly, she has great communication skills and rapport with consultants and goes above and beyond for her patients. We had a very busy peds shift and she did a tremendous job in keeping the flow of the ED going, dispositioning patients and keeping track of her work overall. One of the best interns I have worked with by far.
Dr. Horner does a nice job of eliciting family concerns and expectations during the ED visit. She did a nice job on this shift of negotiating through the mine-field of a chronically ill child with a trach, g-tube and "increased agitation". Child ended up admitted to the PICU w/sepsis and pneumonia. She was able to seriously consider parental concerns and allow those concerns to play the critical role in assessing this particular child.
Rachel did an extraordinary job of keeping the ED running while the upper level and I were tied up with critical patients in the Resus room for 3 hours. She had great assessments and plans for all of her patients, and the signouts as well. Definitely functioning at 2nd year level already.
Quickly evaluates patients. Easily manages multiple patients simultaneously. Follows up on all studies.
Rachel is an outstanding intern, very difficult to recommend any improvements, notes are outstanding, hard working and thorough. By far, an outstanding intern, far above her peers.
Outstanding, consistent intern. Recommend for commendation for her class.
Rachel does an outstanding job of caring for her patients. She keeps track of the signouts in a similar fashion. Her plans are complete and logical, taking into account the limitations of the system.
Seems to feel more comfortable with ordering tests, always comes to me appropriately when considering more invasive testing or when there is a question of which test should be ordered. Verbalizes her thought process for testing logically.
Always asks for feedback, is very self aware in terms of knowledge gaps - always gets help appropriately.
Excellent care of status asthmatics / appropriate initial approach and ongoing management as child developed worsening oxygenation. Also, handled a non-sick infant well - poor social situation w/homeless family - appropriately recognized family’s need for immediate resources and was able to intervene by getting social work involved
At this point in her training, one of Courtney’s strengths is to continually ask how she can improve - not only on patient care but on charting, ED flow, and patient satisfaction. She seeks out feedback and makes every effort to implement suggestions into her own practice style. She is a wonderful addition to the team, a pleasure to work with, and considerate of her colleagues.
Courtney is continually assessing her patients and her approach to patient care. She is recognizing her limitations and expanding her knowledge base rapidly!
Continues to excel!
Works very well independently, good plans, keeps me informed

She is easy to work with, and a great communicator. Her patients were very appreciative and liked her. Keep up the good work and don’t let the stress of the ED burn you out - keep smiling. :-D
You were a star tonight! You saw more patients than the upper level, managed your signouts and did a fantastic job, despite some difficult patients. We discussed some techniques for managing patient expectations regarding admission, pain management and how to manage the pt with multiple complaints. Experiment with some of the techniques and let me know how it goes.
You did a very nice job of managing the patient with multiple complaints, and managing his expectations. You recognized his depressive sx and the anxiety over possible cancer. I think he was happy with the way things went, and will follow up with the echo, etc.
I am comfortable leaving her alone to see patients in the pod while I am in resuscitation. She actively manages her patients and knows the limits to her knowledge.
Appropriately decided not to ct scan a pt who had 5 ct’s this year already for nephrolithiasis
Courtney is very sensitive to respecting patients, the ethical principles involved in patient care, and demonstrates respect felt by all
Courtney is ahead of the game in terms of thinking toward disposition, using the system well, and creatively coming up with solutions for difficult dispositions.
Courtney exhibits a level of departmental awareness that I have not seen in some of the more senior residents, let alone an intern. She performs nicely focused H&Ps and is always looking to improve. She is wonderful to work with and I look forward to seeing her grow even more into an excellent clinician in the next 2.5 years
Courtney able to manage multiple patients simultaneously while still delivering high quality care to all. She is always thoughtful about all aspects of care, rarely missing any important points in management. She thought ahead in a pediatric burn patient paged to ED in terms of relevant issues, knew good management of all key points, although ultimately turning over care to another resident who wanted the case.
Managed agitated pt appropriately with haldol and ativan. Protected staff from injury, as well as pt.

Kristen is extremely bright and uses evidence based principles to learn and improve her patient care. She is open to suggestions for improvement and readily integrates them into practices. She is doing well

Included in patient safety here is seeking out clarification from alternative sources for true stories/odd plans/pieces of the puzzle that didn’t fit. Excellent pursuit of alternative sources.
1 
Great use of FAST in trauma bay, AND good use with ocular US for papilledema; sought to actively learn on this issue on my shift.
2 
Great list of differentials, good analysis of emergent causes, both less likely and more remote; we discussed the importance of at least having remote diagnosis on the differential in the back of your mind, even if you opt not actively pursue testing for that remote diagnosis at first
3 
Very thorough. Managed multiple complicated sign-outs well - didn’t let anyone slip through the cracks during a busy night shift. Very pleasant to work with - Sara has a great attitude and work ethic.

0 
What a challenging case! You did a great job of thinking through the possibilities and ordering the plan for treatment. Great idea to use ketamine instead of etomidate for the ETT - it helped his BP. Also delaying the intubation until we had a better BP (after fluids and pressors) was essential. He would have died if we had tubed him with a BP of 60!
1 
Very nice job facilitating flow through the ED. Looks out for fellow residents / manages her patients effectively
2 
Sara seems to have a better grip on the medical evidence than most residents. She clearly reads a lot and utilizes other sources of education such as podcasts to stay on top of the latest literature and clinical recommendations.

5 
I have supervised Sarah on at leave 6 very challenging and difficult airways. She has managed every one of them appropriately while making them look easy, even when they were not. Follows the checklist, thinks through backups, evaluates the airway. Had a second chance at an airway she missed a couple of months ago - same pt but in even more severe respiratory distress - she prepared the patient and the team and intubated using CMAC quickly and prevented a further desaturation in a pt already low. I would trust her to manage any intubation on any patient under any circumstance.
6 
Excellent with time outs for procedural sedations. Accounts for choices in medications, amounts, follows closely oxygen and ETC02.
7 
Excellent with differentials, thinks about possibilities, progressing well.

Tiffany did a great job of staying ahead of me in terms of re evaluating and reassess in her patience. She was on top of all of her results and arranged for disposition even before we Had a chance to touch base. Great job for so early in 2nd year
3 
Excellent approach to regional anesthesia in complicated facial laceration from dog bite
4 
Good management of patient with HIV who was very particular about describing his physical symptoms and very sensitive about his HIV background. Established a good rapport with a difficult patient

6 
Great clinical case for posterior hip dislocation - physical exam finding, then procedural sedation for relocation.
7 
Excellent shift. Saw a ton of patients with ease. Handled signed out patients well.

9 
Strong resident. Does a nice job managing multiple patients. follows up without prompting.
0 
Very complex signouts requiring significant amount of effort to close; excellent job of sorting out the issues, which were not always readily apparent.;

4 
Did LP with Steve - discussed "walking" up vertebrae, squaring up hips and shoulders - VERY successful second LP. Also did thoracentesis with Ashley - very smooth!

1 
Had several patients in the Ped ED today requiring teasing out information from prior charts and comparing presentations - one in particular was a 3mo with a history of pulmonary htn now presenting w/periodic apnea. Dr. Peterson was able to dissect prior charts to determine that child’s pulmonary htn had essentially resolved - allowing for consideration of other etiologies for child’s ALTE.
2 
Excellent communication skills and pt. rapport.
3 
Didn’t have very difficult interactions tonight - but communicates well with patients regardless of age or sophistication. Had a patient who wanted GB removed immediately and gracefully worked with UNM and SRMC to try to accommodate patients wishes. Seems to be able to walk the line between being helpful and being a doormat ;-)
4 
Called the cardiology fellow for EMS page re. STEMI as heads up and was able to mobilize cath team quickly once STEMI was confirmed - nice balance between trying to prevent unnecessary activations while cutting down response time.
5 
I think I was more scared than Tiffany was when she intubated a patient with airway edema after a fire/burns. She used the bougey and glidescope smoothly and was incredibly calm and controlled through the entire process. Needed to move down to a smaller tube, didn’t have a full view of cords, but made it look easy. Very well done!
6

7 
Excellent for level of training!
8 
During our shift Aimee saw many resus patients and was able to effectively manage them as well as follow up/dispo several patients she received at sign out. Overall her ability to multi-task is definitely improving.
9 
Aimee works hard at having a well thought out disposition set up for all her patients, particularly those which are not yet ready for discharge/admit at time of turn-over.
00 
Aimee is becoming very adapt at establishing very good rapport with her patients, even the difficult ones, and has a good working relationship with the ED nurses and consultants

Made a point not to let patient’s care be delayed by anticipated obstacles to care, particularly language barrier. Patiently obtained complete history and exam through phone interpreter. Thoughtful approach and differential. Worked very hard to be sure pt and family understood plan, treatment, and follow up. Also, in terms of resus room patients--this was very early in the 2nd year and Ashley did a very nice job managing the room during a TAP trauma.
07 
Good instincts re: determining admit vs dc disposition. Appropriately persistent in attempting to obtain consult recommendations.
08 
Operating like a 3rd year already (seriously)

We talked about putting a femoral line in during code situations and approaches to doing it quickly - and boom! - an hour later Ashley had an opportunity to do just that and it went smoothly. Well done! Continue to practice this skill - it is very helpful in these cases.
14 
Excellent with a very busy ED!
15 
2 very smooth intubations in difficult patients - one head injured trauma pt needing c spine stabilization. The other was actively posturing and with huge sympathomimetic response - intubated quickly. The pt desaturated anyway due to his underlying metabolic demand - interesting to see how quickly he dropped to the 70’s but came right back up.
16 
Ashley really kept on top of her patients today, both signouts and patients she saw initially
17

21 
Excellent job and rapport with consultants; worries about flow of the ED and managing most difficult patients
22 
very nice closure of two facial lacerations
23

24 
Consistently appropriate balance between confidence in things you do know, acknowledgment of when you have questions. Genuinely wants to do the right thing for patients--keep it up!
25 
We set a goal this morning for Ashley to do earlier targeted chart review for selected patients - it seemed this went well, although we had a less busy resus day than yesterday
26 
Evaluation for 3/16-17/15 night shift: Did a great job on a very difficult night shift. Many admitted patients and ED in complete gridlock. Ashley saw 10 new patients and also managed a ton of signouts without dropping the ball on any of them. Very impressive for a second year resident! Also did a great job of managing an Ativan OD with AKI who was on lithium. She contacted the appropriate services, prioritized care appropriately, and handled ("educated") the MICU resident who was clueless as to how to mange the pt. Also a pleasure to work with - many good interactions throughout the night, discussions about management options, etc.

35 
Great job managing critically ill GI bleed patient. Putting in lines quickly is a good move - these patients can decompensated very quickly. Good communication with nurses/techs.
36 
Asks appropriate questions - knows limits and seeks help when necessary (but not too often - knowledge and clinical skills are well above average for this stage of training). Hard working, great attitude, a pleasure to work with!

She did a great assessment of a pt. with undifferentiated shock, and developed a broad differential, with treatment for each. Really functioning at 3rd year level.
48 
Terrific job with challenging intubation. Demonstrated clear preparation and informed decision making when setting up for airway management.
49 
Patient with complicated medical history presenting with CHF exacerbation--improving some on bipap, but improvement was slower than one might expect. Courtney did an excellent job managing this resus patient (and the rest of the resus patients during the shift). She was confident, incorporated feedback appropriately, and was a great patient advocate. Very well done overall--especially this early in second year.
50 
Well above level of training in system delivery and flow

Ankle u/s - a new frontier!
 
8 yo female w/laryngeal tracheal disruption - bilateral pneumothoraces, sedation issues, thinking through difficult airway, potential for cardiopulmonary compromise and acute respiratory deterioration / pooled together resources and never once became complacent in her thinking about and reviewing the case for better options, additional resources that may be helpful. Really hard on herself after the case looking back at every step that was taken to see if there were things that could’ve been done along the way to help the case to have run more smoothly to improve patient outcome.

Jen had several difficult patients (language and cognitive barriers) on yesterday’s shift - she effectively used the Vietnamese translator with 2 patients (and their families) and sought out additional information via phone with family members of an intoxicated patient who was presenting with possible stroke symptoms but couldn’t give an adequate history. She takes additional time when necessary to more fully explore the concerns of patients presenting with difficult clinical presentations (young woman with great frustration over her chronic abdominal pain and another patient with a history of multiple CVA - ischemic and hemorrhagic - to determine the patient’s concerns and how to best convey them to the neurology service to facilitate their evaluation of the patient)
